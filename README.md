Fresh Breathies, My MIlestone Project for college

Description:
Building a website using html and css. I have been studying html and css and needed to write code for a website which has either 3 section or at least 3 pages for the first milestone in my course. I had the idea of writting a blog website but i need to learn more to be able to achive what i want, so i built this little website instead. the front page has a menu with a logo, with a hero image below, about section, ingredients aection and a footer. I have used flex box to stack the ingredients on top of another when using a mobile phone. 

The post page has a max width for larger screen sizes. 

I have used dev tools to test the site. The site is responsive and works well on desk top and tablet. 
The site has been tested on all of these devices:

IPHONE SE
IPHONE XR
IPHONE 12 PRO
PIXEL 5
SAMSUNG GALAXY S8+
SAMSUNG GALAXY S20 ULTRA
IPAD AIR
IPAD MINI
SURFACE PRO 7
SURFACE DUO
SAMSUNG GALAXY A51/71
NEST HUB
NEST HUB MAX

One day i would like to have a large website with lots of posts which can be access on the home page.
