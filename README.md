Fresh Breathies, My MIlestone Project for college

Description:
Building a website using html and css. I have been studying html and css and needed to write code for a website which has either 3 section or at least 3 pages for the first milestone in my course. I had the idea of writting a blog website but i need to learn more to be able to achive what i want, so i built this little website instead. the front page has a menu with a logo, with a hero image below, about section, ingredients aection and a footer. I have used flex box to stack the ingredients on top of another when using a mobile phone. 

The post page has a max width for larger screen sizes. 

I have used dev tools to test the site. The site is responsive and works well on desk top and tablet. 
The site has been tested on all of these devices:

IPHONE SE
IPHONE XR
IPHONE 12 PRO
PIXEL 5
SAMSUNG GALAXY S8+
SAMSUNG GALAXY S20 ULTRA
IPAD AIR
IPAD MINI
SURFACE PRO 7
SURFACE DUO
SAMSUNG GALAXY A51/71
NEST HUB
NEST HUB MAX

One day i would like to have a large website with lots of posts which can be access on the home page. 

This website is a landing page with information about a product, which helps dogs bad breath, from the inside out. These dog chews have 5 natural ingredients, with various health benefits. The user can sign up to get the special offer. I would then collect the details the user typed in the form and start a sales funnel, sending emails about various products at different times. Then i would be able to build a email list. I would have to learn how to collect the data and store it, then use the data to email customers on email list. 

The site is easy to navigate using the menu, there is a home page, post page and sign up page. I tried to keep the color scheme the same on every page and added logo image. The logo image can be seen on every page and is also a link to the home page.
